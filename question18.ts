// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
let diffPlaces:string[]=["K2","River Indus","Islamabad","Urdu","Pakistan"]
for (let index = 0; index < diffPlaces.length; index++)
{
    const element = diffPlaces[index];
    console.log(element)
